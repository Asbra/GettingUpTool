# Marc Ecko's Getting Up Mod Tool

Please [report any issues](https://github.com/Asbra/GettingUpTool/issues).

In the future this tool will be a more comprehensive modding tool, not only for textures.

## Installation
[Download the latest release](https://github.com/Asbra/GettingUpTool/releases/latest) and extract anywhere.

## Usage
When you start the tool it will attempt to find where your game is installed. Failing this it will ask you to show it.

Please see the Wiki page "[Replacing textures in game](https://github.com/Asbra/GettingUpTool/wiki/Replacing-textures-graffiti-in-Marc-Ecko's-Getting-Up)" to insert your own graffiti into the game.
